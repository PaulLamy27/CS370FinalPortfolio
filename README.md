For this project, we were given the variables initiated and the pseudocode for the Q learning algorithm, as well as some extra functional code for the treasure map.
I made the Q-learning algorithm and made sure that it passed all of the tests.
Computer scientists investigate systems that are computational, how to make these and the impact these can have. 
I approach the problem as a computer scientist, and this means I looked at the problem, divided it into steps in pseudocode, and write the code. This is more of a software engineer than a computer scientist, 
but they are similar in that both SEs and computer scientists can investigate a system and how to make it.
My ethical responsibilities include making code that is easy for the audience to understand, is safe and does not make anyones personal info vulnerable, and to make a system that has no negative impact but a positive impact on the humans it is meant to serve.
This is vital for the organization, but also on a personal level, as what people see as personal and do not want to be shared should not be shared.
